<ul> PasswordStrengthChecker.js — checks how strong a given password is. </ul>
<ul> array-max-min.js — finds the maximum and minimum values in an array. </ul>
<ul> simple-calculator.js — performs basic arithmetic operations. </ul>
<ul> wordFrequency.js — calculates how often each word appears in a text. </ul>
